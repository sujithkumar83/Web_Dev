        <h1>This is an example of heading</h1>
        
        <h2>Now let's look at the paragraph</h2>
        
        <p>This is an example fo a paragraph. It is a continuous block of text which can be introduced. Line breaks introduced in the text do not work out. They need to be called out using the 'br' tag. Here is an example. <br>
        See how it has now introduced a line break. Pretty neat huh? Let's go to next line and see the use of 'strong' and 'u' tags.<br>
            
        <h2> Formattings</h2>
            This is a <strong>bold</strong> format achieved by using 'strong' tag. <br>
            This is an example of <em>emphasize</em> text which is using 'em' tag. <br>
            This is an example of <u>underline</u> format using 'u' tag. <br>
        <h2> Inserting Images</h2>
        <img src="Family.jpg">
        <h2> This is us!</h2>
        <h2>Internal and external links</h2>
            <h3>External links</h3>
                This is an example of the link fuctionality using 'a' tag. <br>
                <a href="https://www.google.com/">This is the link to Google</a>
            
                Here is another way to do it (by letting it open in a new tab using 'target' attribute)<br>
                <a href=https://www.google.com target=_blank>This opens Google in new tab</a>
            <h3>Internal Links</h3>
                <a href="Family.jpg" target=_blank>Family pic</a>
